# sign-up-form
This project is a great opportunity to review what I've learned from TOP's intermediate HTML and CSS course.

Summary: Creating forms and form validation is incredibly fun to learn as it's something we use all the time. I feel one step closer to building a full-scale web app! For this project, I emphasized creating a responsive layout and an interface with great usability. I also created a custom form validation for the password and confirm password inputs using JavaScript, maybe next time I'll try including some regular expressions.
